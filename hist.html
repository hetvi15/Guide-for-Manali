	<p>Manali, often referred as the <b><i>'Valley of Gods’</i></b> is believed to have a fabled past. The mythological history states 
that Manali was the abode of the great <b>Sage Manu</b>, the <i>lawmaker of Mankind</i>. It is believed that Sage Manu stepped
 out of his ark in Manali to recreate the human life, after a devastative flood deluged the whole world.
 The word Manali is regarded to be the changed name of ‘Manu-Alaya’, meaning the home of Manu. 
 However, the factual history states that the modern Manali was recognized as an exquisite summer
 resort by the Colonial rulers of erstwhile British India. They used to visit this exotic resort town
 during the summers to escape the scorching and blistering heat of the Northern Plains.</p>

<p><br>Manali is full of historical monuments and is the best place to witness the unfolding antiquity. The History of Manali gives an
 overall idea of the beautiful region. According to legends, the history continues from the Ramayana period. 
 The name of the river Beas is designated by common traditions celebrated by the <b><i>saint Vashishtha</i></b>, whose 
 references are available in the <i>Ramayana</i>. After the death of his son, he lost his interest in life, and jumped 
 in the river with his feet and hands tied. But the divine river burst his bonds and, carried him to the shore. 
 The river came to be known as <b>‘Vipasha’ or ‘the liberator of bonds.’</b> He then again threw himself into the Satluj 
 but, the sacred waters of the river divided into hundred shallow channels and, sent the sage on dry land. Then 
 the river is known as <b>‘Satadree’ or ‘the hundred channeled.’</b></p><br>
 <p>According to the <b>Hindu mythology</b>- Manali was the 
 hometown of the Brahmin law enforcer Manu and got its name after him as he was struck by the beauty and 
 tranquility after wandering through the valleys of Himalayan town. Manali is the changed name from the word 
 <b>“Manu-Alaya” meaning- house of Manu</b>.The History of Manali is that the seventh incarnation of Manu found a tiny 
 fish who told him to look after it with devotion and then one day it would do him a great service. 
 Vaivasvatatava cared for the fish till the day it grew into a huge one. He released it into the sea but, 
 the fish warned him about a threatening deluge in which the entire world would be submerged and asked him 
 to build a boat. When Manu and other Gods were submerged, they were saved by the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu 
 by mounting high to drylands. As the earth gradually dried, there arose a place of breathtaking natural beauty
 which was relevant, for the life to begin again. <br></p>
 <p>As the legend says, Manali was completely inaccessible to 
 humans due to its topographical positioning. Today, it is a prime destination which offers high mountains 
 surrounded by white glittering snow. There are thick forests full of cool breezes and birdsong as well as 
 the gardens of wildflowers, picturesque hamlets and fruit loaded orchards.The Hidimba temple in Manali is 
 believed to be associated with the Pandavas. According to the sagas, Bhimsen killed a strong and cruel demon 
 Hadimb and married his sister Hadimba who was a sturdy deity whereas another legend says Arjuna practiced 
 self-discipline in a cave called <b>‘Arjun Gupha’</b>to get the powerful Pasupati Astra from Indra. 
 During the Mahabharata period, the great sage Vyas have performed his tapa at a place called ‘Vyas Kund’
 on Rohtang Pass.The city is also termed as “The Valley of Gods.” There is a temple in old Manali dedicated
 to sage Manu. Manali and the surrounding areas are said to be home to the Sapta rishi or seven sages making 
 it relevant in the Indian culture and heritage.In the ,17th century, <b>Raja Jagat Singh</b> brought the statue of
 Lord Raghunath ji to his throne and, till now he is the presiding god and the king of Manali. 
 In the 20th century, the British started visiting the town frequently due to its pleasant climate,
 nature and scenic views. With the invasion of Britishers, the culture of Manali experiences a subtle change. 
 The Britishers also introduce the roads, restaurants, churches and other attractions to impress the tourists 
 whereas adventurous activities like skiing, snow-racing and, skating were developed by foreigners. 
 The first apple orchard was set up by them in <b>Patlikulh</b>. Even today, apples along with plum and pear 
 as well are the foremost source of income of the people of Manali. It is one of the reasons that Manali gained the reputation of being a
 tourist destination.Manali has a unique culture and tradition which is rooted in the hearts of the local people. It is an exciting
 destination situated on the Himalayas and the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh at a height of ,<b>2625 meters</b> (8612 feet) where the hills of
 Manali present stunning landscape.</p>
